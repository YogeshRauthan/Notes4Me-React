# Notes4Me-React
I created a comprehensive MERN stack project that includes both backend and frontend development. The backend setup involved creating an Express server, setting up MongoDB with Mongoose, and implementing routes for user authentication and note management. I also added data validation, password hashing, and JWT-based authentication. On the frontend, I set up a React application, created components, and used Context API and hooks like useContext and useLocation. The project features adding, fetching, updating, and deleting notes, along with a login and signup system, and includes alerts and frontend validation for a seamless user experience.
